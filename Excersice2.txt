1.What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

 * When increase the number of hidden nodes(n_h), the network becomes more capable of capturing complex 
   relationships in the data. 

2.Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase? 

 * When we have less number of hidden nodes, the network may struggle to capture the complexities of the data.So,it cannot learn underlying patterns and result in underfitting.
   Therefor, the training and testing accuracy will be low. But when we increase the number of hidden nodes, model can fit training data closely.So, accuracy will be high.
   If we increase it within a large amount,it will be overfitted and testing accuracy will be decreased.
